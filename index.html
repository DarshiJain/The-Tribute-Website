                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR </b>(15 October 1931 - 27
                    July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
                    served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
                    and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
                    aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
                    and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                    space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
                    came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
                    development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                    technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
                    1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
